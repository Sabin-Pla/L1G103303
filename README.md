# Names of Files

### Package actor_events 

The actor_events package contains the events used for the simulation of events which are instantiated by real-world people and represent physical action, (ie pressing a button). 

Classes:
#### CarButtonEvent
This class handles the events related to when a button is pressed
#### RequestElevatorEvent
This class handles the request events to be processed by the elevator

### Package Common

The common package contains much of the miscellaneous boilerplate behaviour common to all subsystems. This includes classes which facilate the behaviour of time based events.

Classes:
#### Parser
Parses a file with strings delimited by new lines in the form `10:15:59.0 1 Up 4` denoting floor button press time, source floor, desired direction, and destination floor (which car button should be hit when the elevator arrives). 
#### SimulationClock
Used to redefine timescales for simulating series of events sent over a long period of time. For instance, the user may want to simulate 3 days worth of events in 3 minutes.
#### TimeEvent
An event that has a start time (i.e, a time it was or should be sent). TimeEvents have a hasPassed() method, indicating whether or not an event has passed with respect to a given [Time](#Time) object.
#### TimeException
An exception for when time-based events are set to occur at invalid times
#### TimeQueue
An implementation of a PriorityQueue that contains TimeEvents. It will reject the addition of any events that have passed (according to the timescale set by a Tie object). Priority is given to earlier events.

### Package Elevator
The elevator package contains the classes pertaining to the elevator itself 

Classes:
#### Elevator
This class models the elevator

### Package Floor:
This package contains classes pertaining to the floor subsystem

Classes:
#### ElevatorWaitTimeException
Exception class for there being too long a wait time between the time an elevator is requested and arrives
#### Floor
The floor class sends requests to the schedulers and operates its floor lamp.
#### InvalidDirectionException
An exception for if "going down" to a higher floor or "going up" to a lower floor

### Package remote_procedure_events 
This package contains the events used for inter-process communication such as when a car button is pressed, when a floor button is spressed, and when the elevator arrives at a floor.

Classes:
#### CarButtonPressEvent
This class handles the evnts when a car button is pressed.
#### ElevatorMotorEvent
This class handles the elevator motor and its functions
#### FloorArrivalEvent
This class handles the time event and floor/elevator information when an elevator arrives at a floor.
#### FloorButtonPressEvent
This class handles the port listener and the events triggered when a floor button is pressed.

### Package Scheduler
Contains the scheduler class

Classes:
#### Scheduler
Schedules requests for both the elevator and floor subsystem
#### ElevatorPositionException
Exception class for the reported elevator floor not matching up with where the scheduler expects it to be

### Package Tests
The tests package contains unit tests to validate the behaviour of each class.

One integrated test, IntegratedEventTest exists to demonstrate threads sequentially sending the events in a TimeQueue as they pass according to a simulated time scale of 60x speed.

# Setup & Test Instructions
### Note on Simulation File Format
The simulation files are formatted as follows:
<timestamp simulation start time> <time compression>
### Setup and Test
1. Extract the zip file to your desktop.
2. In eclipse: File -> Import -> Projects from Folder or Archive -> 
3. Click "archive" and select the zip file containing this README.md.
4. Click "Finished"

In order to run unit tests:  
1. right click the "tests" package in the project explorer pane 
2. click Run As -> JUnit Test

In order to execute the simulation and run integration testing if the requestFile supports it:  
The Scheduler, Floor, and Elevator can each be individually started by right clicking their respective .java files and clicking Run As -> Java Application
The Floor must be started last as the simulation begins when it's done initializing
